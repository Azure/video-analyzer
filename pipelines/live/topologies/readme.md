# Pipeline Topologies

Each sub-folder in this directory contains the JSON file, description, and diagram for a live pipeline topology. The following table also lists each topology along with a short description, its corresponding sample tutorial(s), and its corresponding pipeline topology name on the [Azure Video Analyzer extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.azure-video-analyzer) on Visual Studio Code (VSCode). Clicking on a topology name redirects to the corresponding JSON file.
