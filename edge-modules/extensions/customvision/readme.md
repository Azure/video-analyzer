# Custom Vision

[Azure Custom Vision](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/overview) is an image recognition service that lets you build, deploy, and improve your own image identifiers. Using the [AI extensibility capability](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-video-analyzer/video-analyzer-docs/analyze-live-video-without-recording#analyzing-video-using-a-custom-vision-model) of Video Analyzer you can deploy an AI inference service on the edge for detecting objects such as toy trucks from a live video stream.

## Running and testing
